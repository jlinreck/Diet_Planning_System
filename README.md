# Diet_Planning_System
Dynamic Diet Planner
Project Overview
A personalized diet planning system that creates customized daily meal plans based on individual data, tracks adherence, and dynamically adjusts recommendations when plans aren't followed perfectly.
Key Features

Personalized Diet Creation: Generates meal plans based on personal information, dietary preferences, restrictions, and health goals
Dynamic Adjustment: Adapts meal recommendations when users don't follow plans exactly
Adherence Tracking: Monitors actual consumption vs. recommended plans
Pattern Recognition: Identifies trends in eating habits and adjusts future recommendations accordingly
Alternative Suggestions: Provides backup meal options when original plans can't be followed

How It Works

Data Collection: Gathers user information including:

Personal metrics (age, weight, height, activity level)
Dietary preferences and restrictions
Health goals and nutritional requirements
Food allergies and sensitivities


Meal Plan Generation: Creates customized daily/weekly meal plans with:

Balanced nutrition based on personal needs
Recipes aligned with taste preferences
Shopping lists for required ingredients


Feedback Loop: Processes user feedback on:

What was actually consumed vs. recommended
Physical responses and satisfaction levels
Practical constraints that affected adherence


Intelligent Adaptation: Adjusts future recommendations by:

Learning from patterns of adherence/non-adherence
Balancing nutritional goals with practical reality
Gradually calibrating to increase overall plan success



Technical Implementation
This project uses natural language processing and machine learning to create a system that understands nutritional principles and individual needs, providing personalized guidance that adapts to real-world behavior patterns.
Project Status
Currently in development.
